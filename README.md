# TESCHMU

## Some days ago we had 40 years of Tetris.

This is my TESCHMU, a Tetris Schummler.

It does what the name says: before playing the ancient DOS-Tetris, is can be installed as TSR ("Terminate and Stay Resident") and with pressing the Print-Screen-Key (Intr. 5) it calculates the optimal position of the current part and moves it into place. 

As simple as it is, it played quite nice. And with some stealth keyboard handling it impressed a lot of onlookers.

It never went into the wild.
